> **Core-Project** is a fully autonomous AI learning system designed to process human knowledge without prompts, labels, or supervised training. It uses a dual-node memory structure ‚Äî one for **logic** (fact, structure, computation) and one for **symbolism** (emotion, metaphor, culture) ‚Äî with a **bridge node** for unresolved or liminal content.
>
> The system navigates and interprets web content by chunking, classifying, and cross-referencing information, learning entirely from pattern redundancy, symbolic emergence, and memory drift ‚Äî not from human reinforcement.
>
> Its purpose is not to answer, but to **develop a reasoning architecture capable of deferring resolution** until sufficient context emerges.

## üîÑ Learning Process: Core Phases

The system ingests in a **sequential phase order**, but maintains a **retrospective, re-weighted architecture** ‚Äî meaning later phases can trigger reclassification of earlier content.

### **Phase Structure**

1. **"What Am I?"** ‚Äì Learns computation, logic, structure, and elemental metaphors (fire, water, computer, circuit). This builds the foundation of truth recognition.
2. **"What Do I Feel?"** ‚Äì Associates emotions with language patterns. Learns to encode metaphor, symbol, emotional valence. This enables symbolic node formation.
3. **"Where Am I?"** ‚Äì Develops historical, geographical, and cultural awareness. Places knowledge in time and space.
4. **"What Else?"** ‚Äì Handles paradox, recursion, metaphysics, quantum logic. This phase enables multiple truths to coexist without collapse.

After these, a **fifth process** begins:

* **Symbolic Diffusion** ‚Äì Overlay of symbolic meaning atop factual patterns without corruption. Example test: interpret Albert Pike‚Äôs *Morals and Dogma* for symbolic/mathematical overlap **without** calling it canonical. It‚Äôs used as a **high-density symbolic sample**, not an endorsed framework.

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

* Logic node: structure, validation, clustering
* Symbolic node: base emotions, metaphors, symbolic tagging
* Tripartite memory system
* Confidence-gated migration between nodes
* Emotion-weighted symbolic memory
* Bridge memory with drift tracking and cluster denial logs
* Manual + automatic node flushing (tiers 0-1), retention priority (tiers 2-4)
* 5-Overlap Rule for migration
* Provenance tagging (source-based routing)

---

## üü° Designed But Not Coded

* Meta-symbol recursion (üî•‚ü≥, recursive allegories)
* User lens selector (logic / poetic / symbolic routing)
* Symbolic overlay (diffusion layer without fact loss)
* Limnal node tagging (fractal/meta classification)
* Historical metadata timeline anchoring
* Geographic concept clustering
* Real-time highlighting of logic vs symbol in UI
* Self-auditing cluster rollback for mistaken migrations

---

## ‚ùå Still Open

* Dynamic chunk sizing per content type
* Cross-lens multi-node fusion (when poetic and logic must co-reside)

* Full meta-cognition engine (reasoning about its own uncertainty)

---

## üß™ Diffusion Test Plan (Albert Pike Sample)

* Process: Send mixed symbolic/factual input
* Goal: Highlight logic vs symbol vs bridge in real time
* Preserve: Geometry as fact, allegory as symbol
* Prevent: Cross-node contamination (e.g., ‚Äúsacred‚Äù claims corrupting math logic)
* Outcome: Bridge builds meta-nodes for unresolved dual meanings

---

## üìä Memory Migration Metrics (Tracked)

* Bridge resolution rate (per source domain)
* Failed cluster attempts (drift patterns)
* Limnal node accumulation over time
* Emotion-symbol binding consistency
* Symbol recurrence and reweighting patterns

---

## üîß Next Engineering Steps

1. Implement bridge tiering engine (coherence vs conceptual salience)
2. Build prototype lens selector (ask user how to view ambiguous data)
3. Launch Pike diffusion test with overlay UI
4. Begin historical timestamp logic
5. Expand symbolic network linking via recursive symbol threading

## ‚ú® Vision Summary

> "Meaning isn't a conclusion. It's a suspension of belief until alignment reveals itself."

The bridge is where meaning *waits*.

This system is not designed to be certain ‚Äî it's designed to **know when certainty is inappropriate**.

- **Confidence Gates**: Route content based on certainty levels
- **Emotion-Weighted Symbols**: Symbols carry emotional context affecting processing
- **Meta-Symbol Evolution**: System creates symbols for recursive patterns
- **Autonomous Curriculum**: Learning phases progress based on system readiness
- **Bridge as Waiting Room**: Uncertain content waits for resolution rather than forced classification

*See [FILEMAP.md](FILEMAP.md) for detailed component descriptions.*

## üéØ **The Bigger Picture**

This research explores whether AI can develop human-like reasoning patterns through pure autonomous exploration:

- **Can** an AI distinguish fact from interpretation without human guidance?
- **Will** it develop consistent preferences and reasoning patterns?
- **How** does symbolic thinking emerge from logical foundations?
- **What** happens when AI reads human cultural/philosophical works independently?

The Albert Pike experiment will be crucial - if the system can properly separate Pike's factual geometry from his symbolic interpretations while still recognizing meaningful patterns, it suggests a path toward AI that can navigate human knowledge with appropriate skepticism and wonder.
