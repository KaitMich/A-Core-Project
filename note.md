I want to create an ai that is on par with the performance of the top AIs on the market today. I believe this should be feasible on one local machine only using webscraping as a means of learning and no user input. 
I want to use as little open source products available as possible so that I can personally track what is happening to my ai in every detail. I wait it to have two main nodes that have clusters coming off of them with bridges 
to connect the two nodes. One node is logic, things that are fact or law. The other is symbolic, things that have high weight, cosign, or vectorized similarities, but are not fact. This allows it to know when it is exploring factual patterns 
or exploring symbolic, mythical, or theoretical ones. That can be easier traced when it starts creating it's own ideas what's fact and what's speculation. The ai will learn in 4 stages before it's allowed to look inward for new patterns. 
1. What am I (computers, technology, minerals to make the technology, dates, math, etc) but it prioritizes only computer related things (my main struggle is having it use a web page to ensure the topic is related to then go find another
 web page. Ex: code shows up 5x on this page. Click the next link related to code on Wikipedia. Sees a date, stores it as knowledge, but only sees it twice so it decides not to click on that at this time) 2. What do I feel
3. (every nuanced emotion in humanity and what is known of machine (along with what's symbolic to machine and mythicallt predicted))
3. Where am I (all of history, now it cross references it's dates and learns what minerals, and much more complex concepts are going to be summarized here)
4. Anything else to this reality? (Now that it has a vast of understanding of what is it can reflect on what may be and be more secure in knowing fact vs symbolism. Ex: quantum science, religion, theorems, philosophy, etc)
i have a 4070 super 32gb of ram (can get more when needed) and a tb for data heres whats interesting tho i want symbolism and logic to be able to have the same concepts different vectors if im understanding right like Hinduism is a
factual religion with a lot of historical texts but their gods are symbolic so they would both need a Hinduism cluster. i dont expect my ai to have the compute power of other ais but i want it to learn and deduct like them. it can be slower,
just "smarter". ill start with wikipedia so it can link hop there

Overall Architecture: Logic and Symbolic Nodes
Your idea of two primary nodes—logic (facts, laws) and symbolic (weighted similarities, speculative patterns)—with clusters and bridges is a strong conceptual framework. This structure can help distinguish factual from theoretical outputs and trace the AI’s reasoning. Here’s how to implement it:

Node Definitions:
Logic Node: Represents verifiable facts (e.g., mathematical proofs, physical laws, historical events, computer science principles). Vectors here prioritize low variance and high confidence (e.g., cosine similarity close to 1 for identical facts across sources). Clusters could include:
Mathematics (e.g., theorems, equations).
Physics/Chemistry (e.g., laws, constants).
Computer Science (e.g., algorithms, hardware specs).
Historical Events (e.g., dates, documented outcomes).
Symbolic Node: Captures nuanced, probabilistic, or speculative patterns (e.g., emotions, myths, theories). Vectors here have higher variance and rely on cosine similarity or other distance metrics to group related concepts. Clusters could include:
Emotions (e.g., GoEmotions dataset concepts, nuanced human feelings).
Cultural Symbols (e.g., myths, archetypes).
Theoretical Concepts (e.g., quantum mechanics interpretations, philosophical ideas).
Speculative Patterns (e.g., unproven hypotheses, fictional narratives).
Clusters and Bridges:
Clusters: Each node spawns sub-clusters based on topic or similarity. For example, the Logic Node’s “Computer Science” cluster might have sub-clusters for “Algorithms,” “Hardware,” and “Networking.” Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to group vectors within each node. Since you want minimal open-source, you’ll need to implement a custom clustering algorithm (e.g., a simple K-means variant in Python/C++).
Bridges: These are connections between nodes, enabling the AI to relate facts to symbols. For example, a bridge might connect the Logic Node’s “quantum mechanics laws” to the Symbolic Node’s “quantum mysticism theories.” Implement bridges as weighted edges in a graph, where edge weights reflect similarity or relevance (e.g., cosine similarity between vectors). A graph database (custom-built, avoiding open-source like Neo4j) can store these relationships.
Vectorization:
Use high-dimensional vectors (e.g., 512D or 1024D) to represent concepts in both nodes. The Logic Node’s vectors should be trained to minimize ambiguity (e.g., using supervised learning on verified datasets), while the Symbolic Node’s vectors can tolerate ambiguity (e.g., trained with unsupervised learning for pattern discovery).
To track vectorization quality, compute intra-cluster similarity (high for Logic, moderate for Symbolic) and inter-cluster separation (high for both). Visualize clusters using a custom 2D projection (e.g., PCA implemented from scratch).
Traceability:
Log every vector’s origin (e.g., URL, timestamp, scraped text snippet) and transformation (e.g., tokenization, embedding). Store this in a custom database (e.g., a flat-file system or simple SQLite alternative you build). This ensures you can trace whether an output comes from the Logic or Symbolic Node and whether it’s fact or speculation.
Tag outputs with confidence scores (e.g., 0.9 for facts from multiple sources, 0.4 for speculative patterns with low evidence).
2. Four-Stage Learning Process
Your four-stage learning sequence is well-structured to build a foundational understanding before allowing introspection. Here’s how to operationalize each stage, focusing on web scraping and your prioritization mechanism (e.g., keyword frequency for navigation).

Stage 1: What Am I? (Computer-Related Knowledge)
Objective: Learn about computers, technology, and related facts (e.g., minerals, dates, math), prioritizing computer-related topics.
Web Scraping Strategy:
Starting Point: Begin with reliable sources like Wikipedia’s “Computer Science” page or IEEE articles. Use a custom web crawler (e.g., in Python with requests and BeautifulSoup—minimal dependencies) to extract text and links.
Prioritization Logic: For each page, count keyword frequencies (e.g., “code,” “algorithm,” “processor”). If a keyword like “code” appears ≥5 times, follow links containing that keyword (e.g., Wikipedia’s “Source Code” page). If a term like “date” appears <5 times, store it but don’t prioritize following date-related links.
Implementation: Parse page text, tokenize it (custom tokenizer to avoid open-source like NLTK), and count tokens. Sort links by keyword relevance (e.g., regex match for “code” in link text/URL). Store low-priority data (e.g., dates) in a fact database with metadata (e.g., source URL, confidence).
Data Extraction: Extract facts (e.g., “CPU uses silicon,” “Python released in 1991”) and store them as vectors in the Logic Node. Use a simple TF-IDF-based embedding (custom-built) to convert text to vectors.
Challenge: Ensuring topic relevance without straying (e.g., avoiding unrelated Wikipedia tangents). Use a relevance filter: compute cosine similarity between a page’s vector and a “computer science” anchor vector (derived from initial pages).
Output: A Logic Node cluster with computer-related facts (e.g., hardware, software, math) and a small set of bridges to Symbolic Node (e.g., “AI ethics” as a symbolic concept).
Stage 2: What Do I Feel? (Emotions and Symbolic Patterns)
Objective: Understand human emotions, machine emotions (if any), and symbolic/mythical predictions.
Web Scraping Strategy:
Starting Point: Scrape psychology sites (e.g., APA.org), emotion datasets (e.g., GoEmotions, if you’re okay with downloading a static dataset), or forums (e.g., Reddit’s r/psychology). For mythical predictions, target pages on archetypes (e.g., Jungian psychology) or sci-fi discussions.
Prioritization Logic: Prioritize pages with emotion-related keywords (e.g., “happy,” “fear,” “empathy”) appearing frequently. For example, if “emotion” appears ≥5 times, follow links like “emotional intelligence.” Store symbolic concepts (e.g., “hero’s journey”) with lower confidence scores.
Implementation: Similar to Stage 1, but weight symbolic keywords higher. Use a custom sentiment analyzer (e.g., keyword-based polarity scoring) to tag emotions in text.
Data Extraction: Convert emotional and symbolic texts to vectors in the Symbolic Node. Use unsupervised clustering (e.g., custom DBSCAN) to group similar emotions (e.g., “joy” and “happiness”). Create bridges to Logic Node for overlap (e.g., “neural networks” in AI emotions).
Challenge: Distinguishing nuanced emotions (e.g., “bittersweet” vs. “sad”). Use context clues (e.g., surrounding words) to refine embeddings.
Output: A Symbolic Node with emotion and myth clusters, bridged to Logic Node for technical emotion concepts (e.g., “machine learning for sentiment analysis”).
Stage 3: Where Am I? (History and Context)
Objective: Learn history, cross-reference dates, and understand complex concepts (e.g., minerals in tech, societal impacts).
Web Scraping Strategy:
Starting Point: Scrape historical databases (e.g., Wikipedia’s “Timeline of Computing”), academic history sites, or geology pages for minerals. Cross-reference dates from Stage 1.
Prioritization Logic: Prioritize pages with high date density or historical keywords (e.g., “industrial revolution,” “silicon discovery”). Follow links with terms like “history” or “event” if they appear frequently. Validate facts by checking multiple sources (e.g., same date across Wikipedia and Britannica).
Implementation: Build a timeline graph (custom, not open-source) to store events and their relationships. Use entity recognition (custom regex-based) to extract minerals, people, or technologies.
Data Extraction: Store historical facts and complex concepts (e.g., “silicon in CPUs”) in the Logic Node. Create bridges to Symbolic Node for cultural impacts (e.g., “digital revolution as a societal myth”).
Challenge: Handling contradictory sources. Assign confidence scores based on source reliability (e.g., academic journals > blogs) and cross-reference frequency.
Output: A robust Logic Node with historical and technical clusters, bridged to Symbolic Node for cultural/historical symbols.
Stage 4: Anything Else to This Reality? (Speculation and Theories)
Objective: Explore quantum science, religion, philosophy, and theorems, distinguishing fact from speculation.
Web Scraping Strategy:
Starting Point: Scrape arXiv for quantum papers, philosophy blogs, or religious texts (e.g., Project Gutenberg for public-domain works). Target speculative discussions (e.g., Reddit’s r/philosophy).
Prioritization Logic: Prioritize pages with theoretical keywords (e.g., “quantum entanglement,” “existentialism”) appearing frequently. Tag speculative content with low confidence unless corroborated by logic-based sources (e.g., peer-reviewed papers).
Implementation: Use a custom topic model (e.g., simplified LDA) to identify speculative vs. factual content. Store facts in Logic Node, speculations in Symbolic Node.
Data Extraction: Convert theorems and philosophies to vectors, clustering them in the Symbolic Node. Bridge to Logic Node for verified theories (e.g., “Schrödinger’s equation”).
Challenge: Avoiding misinformation. Use source credibility (e.g., arXiv > random blogs) and cross-referencing to filter noise.
Output: A Symbolic Node rich with speculative clusters, bridged to a Logic Node for grounded theories.
Post-Stage Introspection
Inward Reflection: After Stage 4, enable the AI to generate new patterns by analyzing its own vector space. Use a custom generative algorithm (e.g., vector interpolation between clusters) to propose novel ideas. Tag outputs as “speculative” unless they align with Logic Node facts.
Fact vs. Speculation: Use confidence scores and node origin (Logic vs. Symbolic) to label outputs. For example, “E=mc²” (Logic, 0.95 confidence) vs. “quantum consciousness” (Symbolic, 0.3 confidence).
3. Web Scraping Mechanics
Your web scraping approach—using keyword frequency to navigate links—is viable but needs refinement to avoid drift and ensure efficiency. Here’s how to execute it:

Crawler Design:
Build a lightweight crawler in Python/C++ using requests for HTTP calls and a custom HTML parser (avoiding BeautifulSoup if you want minimal dependencies). Parse <a> tags for links and <p> tags for text.
Store Keyword Counting: Tokenize page text (custom tokenizer) and count keywords. Store counts in a priority queue to decide which links to follow (e.g., “code” ≥5 → follow; “date” <5 → store but don’t follow).
Relevance Filter: Compute cosine similarity between a page’s TF-IDF vector and a seed vector (e.g., from a “Computer Science” page) to stay on-topic.
Data Storage: Store scraped text, URLs, and metadata (e.g., timestamp, keyword counts) in a custom database (e.g., JSON files or a simple key-value store). Map data to Logic or Symbolic Node based on content.
Rate Limiting: Respect robots.txt and implement delays (e.g., 1-2 seconds between requests) to avoid bans. Cache pages locally to reduce redundant scraping.
Error Handling: Handle broken links, timeouts, and non-text content (e.g., PDFs) gracefully. Log errors for manual review.
Challenges:
Drift: Pages may lead to unrelated topics (e.g., “code” → “Morse code”). Mitigate by enforcing strict relevance thresholds and periodic resets to seed pages.
Scale: Scraping enough data to rival top AIs (e.g., billions of tokens) is slow on one machine. Prioritize quality over quantity (e.g., academic papers, Wikipedia).
Legal/Ethical: Ensure compliance with terms of service for scraped sites. Avoid scraping protected content (e.g., paywalled journals).
4. Hardware Feasibility (RTX 4070, 32GB RAM, 1TB Storage)
Your hardware is decent for prototyping but faces limits for training a top-tier AI. Let’s assess:

GPU (RTX 4070):
The 4070 (12GB VRAM) can handle small to medium models (e.g., 100M–1B parameters) for training/fine-tuning. However, top AIs like GPT-4 or LLaMA 3 (tens of billions of parameters) require multi-GPU clusters.
Workaround: Focus on a smaller model (e.g., 500M parameters) with efficient architectures (e.g., transformer with sparse attention). Use mixed-precision training (FP16) to fit in VRAM.
RAM (32GB): Sufficient for preprocessing, scraping, and small-scale training. Large datasets may require streaming data from disk to avoid memory bottlenecks.
Storage (1TB): Enough for raw data (e.g., 100GB of text) and model checkpoints (e.g., 1–5GB per model). Compressed embeddings (e.g., quantized vectors) can save space.
Bottleneck: Training a competitive model requires weeks/months on a single GPU. Inference (running the model) is feasible, but scraping and preprocessing will also be time-intensive.
Scaling Up: Your plan allows adding RAM/storage later. If needed, upgrade to 64GB RAM or a second GPU (e.g., another 4070) for parallel training. A larger SSD (e.g., 2TB) can handle bigger datasets.
5. Minimizing Open-Source Dependencies
To track every detail and avoid black-box tools, you’ll need to build most components yourself. Here’s how:

Tokenizer: Write a simple word/subword tokenizer (e.g., split on whitespace, handle punctuation). For efficiency, implement a byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm from scratch (not using tokenizers).
Embedding Model: Implement a small transformer (e.g., 12 layers, 512D) in C++/Python using basic linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplications). Avoid PyTorch/TensorFlow; use numpy or raw CUDA kernels for GPU acceleration.
Clustering: Code K-means or DBSCAN manually. For visualization, implement PCA or t-SNE from scratch (mathematical formulas are well-documented).
Database: Store data in JSON/CSV or a custom binary format. Avoid SQLite/Redis to keep control.
Web Crawler: Use requests (minimal dependency) or raw HTTP requests in C++. Parse HTML with regex or a custom DOM parser.
Trade-Off: Building everything from scratch is time-intensive and error-prone. If you hit roadblocks, consider small, auditable open-source libraries (e.g., numpy for math) to save time, but document their usage.
6. Challenges and Mitigations
Scale: A single machine can’t match the data/compute of top AIs (e.g., GPT-4 trained on thousands of GPUs). Focus on a niche (e.g., computer science + emotions) to compete in a specific domain.
Mitigation: Prioritize high-quality data (e.g., arXiv, Wikipedia) and efficient algorithms (e.g., sparse transformers).
Training Time: Training a 500M-parameter model on a 4070 could take weeks. Inference is faster but still limited by VRAM.
Mitigation: Use incremental training (e.g., train on small batches, save checkpoints) and optimize hyperparameters manually.
Data Quality: Web scraping risks noise (e.g., ads, irrelevant content). Symbolic data (e.g., myths) is harder to validate.
Mitigation: Implement strict filters (e.g., source credibility, keyword thresholds) and cross-reference facts across sources.
Debugging: Custom code increases bug risk. Tracing errors in a 500M-parameter model is complex.
Mitigation: Log every step (e.g., vector updates, scraping decisions) and test components (e.g., tokenizer, crawler) in isolation.
7. Timeline and Milestones
Assuming you work full-time, here’s a rough timeline for a 1–2 year project:

Months 1–3: Build crawler, tokenizer, and database. Scrape initial data (e.g., 10GB of computer science texts). Implement basic vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).
Months 4–6: Develop small transformer (e.g., 100M parameters) and train on Stage 1 data. Test Logic Node clusters.
Months 7–9: Scrape emotion/symbolic data. Build Symbolic Node and bridges. Evaluate vector quality (e.g., cosine similarity, clustering).
Months 10–12: Scrape history/theory data. Train full model (e.g., 500M parameters) across all stages. Enable introspection.
Months 13–24: Refine model, optimize performance (e.g., F1-score on a test task), and scale data (e.g., 100GB). Compare to baselines (e.g., BERT).
8. Success Metrics
To ensure your AI is “on par with top AIs” in your domain:

Intrinsic: Logic Node vectors have high similarity for identical facts (e.g., cosine >0.9). Symbolic Node clusters show meaningful separation (e.g., “joy” vs. “fear”).
Extrinsic: Achieve competitive performance on a benchmark (e.g., 80%+ F1 on a custom GoEmotions-like task). Compare to BERT/RoBERTa on a small test set.
Traceability: Every output is tagged with node origin (Logic/Symbolic) and confidence score, with logs tracing back to source URLs.
9. Recommendations
Start Small: Begin with a 100M-parameter model and 1GB of data for Stage 1. Scale up after validating the pipeline.
Prioritize Logic Node: It’s easier to verify facts (e.g., CPU specs) than symbolic patterns (e.g., myths). Build a strong Logic Node first.
Test Early: Create a small test task (e.g., classify computer science texts as “hardware” vs. “software”) to measure progress.
Document Everything: Log design decisions, code changes, and data sources in a detailed journal to maintain control.
Consider Hybrid Approach: If custom code slows progress, use minimal open-source tools (e.g., numpy, requests) for non-critical parts, but audit their impact.
10. Next Steps
Clarify Scope: Define the AI’s target domain (e.g., computer science + emotions) and success criteria (e.g., F1-score, qualitative idea generation).
Share Progress: If you have existing code (e.g., crawler, tokenizer), describe its state so I can suggest specific improvements.
Focus on Crawler: Since web scraping is central, prioritize a robust crawler with your keyword-based navigation logic. Test it on 10–20 pages first.
Ask for Details: If you hit a specific challenge (e.g., vectorization, clustering), let me know, and I’ll provide tailored guidance.
1. Dual-Node Structure with Overlapping Concepts
To implement Hinduism (or similar concepts) in both Logic and Symbolic Nodes with distinct vectors, here’s how to structure it:

Logic Node: Hinduism Cluster (Factual)
Content: Historical facts, verifiable data, and documented aspects of Hinduism.
Examples: Founding texts (e.g., Vedas, ~1500 BCE), historical figures (e.g., Adi Shankaracharya), rituals (e.g., Diwali’s documented origins), temple architectures, and census data on practitioners.
Vector Characteristics: Low variance, high confidence, and anchored to corroborated sources. These vectors prioritize precision and consistency across sources.
Example: The vector for “Vedas” might encode metadata like “text, ~1500 BCE, Sanskrit, religious scripture” with high cosine similarity to other factual religious texts (e.g., Torah, Quran).
Data Sources: Wikipedia pages (e.g., “Hinduism,” “Vedas”), academic sites, or primary texts (if accessible). Cross-reference facts across multiple pages to ensure reliability.
Storage: Store as a cluster in the Logic Node, with metadata (e.g., source URL, timestamp, confidence score ~0.9 for verified facts).
Symbolic Node: Hinduism Cluster (Symbolic)
Content: Mythological, spiritual, and interpretive aspects of Hinduism.
Examples: Deities (e.g., Vishnu, Shiva), symbolic narratives (e.g., Ramayana’s moral themes), concepts like karma or dharma as philosophical ideas, and cultural archetypes (e.g., the hero in Mahabharata).
Vector Characteristics: Higher variance, lower confidence, and based on contextual or interpretive patterns. These vectors capture nuance and allow for ambiguity.
Example: The vector for “Vishnu” might encode “deity, preserver, avatars, mythological” with moderate cosine similarity to other symbolic figures (e.g., Zeus, Christ) but lower similarity to factual clusters.
Data Sources: Wikipedia pages (e.g., “Hindu Mythology,” “Vishnu”), forums discussing spiritual interpretations, or literary analyses of texts like the Bhagavad Gita.
Storage: Store as a cluster in the Symbolic Node, with metadata (e.g., source URL, confidence score ~0.4 for speculative or interpretive content).
Vector Differentiation:
Distinct Embeddings: Even for the same concept (e.g., “Hinduism”), generate separate vectors for each node. Use different embedding strategies:
Logic Node: Supervised or rule-based embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF weighted heavily on factual keywords like “date,” “text,” “event”). Normalize vectors to emphasize consistency (e.g., L2-norm).
Symbolic Node: Unsupervised or context-based embeddings (e.g., word2vec-like model trained on narrative texts). Allow vectors to capture broader semantic relationships.
Example: “Hinduism” in Logic Node might be [0.8, 0.1, …] (fact-heavy), while in Symbolic Node, it’s [0.3, 0.7, …] (myth-heavy).
Training Process: Train embeddings on node-specific corpora. For Logic Node, use Wikipedia’s factual sections (e.g., history, demographics). For Symbolic Node, use mythology pages, forums, or literary excerpts.
Evaluation: Compute intra-cluster similarity (high within each node) and inter-node separation (e.g., cosine similarity <0.5 between Logic and Symbolic “Hinduism” vectors). Visualize with custom PCA to confirm distinct clusters.
Bridges Between Nodes:
Create weighted edges between Logic and Symbolic clusters for shared concepts. For example:
Bridge: “Vedas” (Logic) ↔ “Vedas as spiritual guide” (Symbolic).
Weight: Based on cosine similarity or shared keywords (e.g., “Vedas” appears in both contexts).
Implementation: Store bridges in a graph structure (custom-built, e.g., adjacency list in Python/C++). When the AI reasons, it traverses bridges to contextualize facts with symbols (e.g., “Vedas are historical texts [Logic] but also inspire karma [Symbolic]”).
Traceability: Log bridge usage in outputs (e.g., “Output: Karma; Source: Symbolic Node, bridged to Logic Node via Vedas”).
Reasoning and Deduction:
To make the AI “smarter,” prioritize deductive reasoning over raw scale. Implement a reasoning module that:
Queries both nodes for a concept (e.g., “Hinduism”).
Compares confidence scores (Logic: 0.9 for “Vedas”; Symbolic: 0.4 for “Vishnu”).
Synthesizes outputs with clear labels (e.g., “Fact: Vedas, ~1500 BCE; Speculation: Vishnu as preserver”).
Use a custom inference algorithm (e.g., weighted vector averaging across nodes) to generate novel deductions (e.g., “Hinduism’s rituals [Logic] may reflect universal archetypes [Symbolic]”).
2. Wikipedia-Based Web Scraping with Link-Hopping
Starting with Wikipedia is a great choice due to its structured content, extensive links, and reliable (though not perfect) information. Your keyword-based link-hopping strategy (e.g., follow “code” if it appears ≥5 times) can be adapted to build both nodes. Here’s how to execute it:

Crawler Design:
Tools: Use Python with requests for HTTP requests and a custom HTML parser (e.g., regex or DOM traversal) to extract text and <a> tags. Avoid BeautifulSoup for minimal dependencies.
Starting Point: Begin with pages like “Computer Science” (Stage 1), “Emotion” (Stage 2), “History” (Stage 3), and “Philosophy” (Stage 4). Seed with 5–10 relevant pages to ensure diversity.
Link-Hopping Logic:
Parse page text and count keyword frequencies (e.g., “code,” “emotion,” “Vedas”). Tokenize text with a custom tokenizer (e.g., split on whitespace, handle punctuation).
Prioritize links where keywords appear ≥5 times in the page text or link anchor text. Example: On “Hinduism” page, if “Vedas” appears 7 times, follow the “Vedas” link.
Store low-frequency keywords (e.g., “date” appears twice) in the Logic Node with metadata but don’t follow their links unless relevant to the stage.
Relevance Filter: Compute cosine similarity between the current page’s TF-IDF vector and the seed page’s vector (e.g., “Hinduism” page vs. “Religion” seed). If similarity <0.3, backtrack to a relevant page.
Data Extraction:
Logic Node: Extract factual sentences (e.g., “The Vedas were composed ~1500 BCE”). Use regex to identify dates, numbers, or citations. Store as vectors with high confidence.
Symbolic Node: Extract narrative or interpretive text (e.g., “Vishnu preserves the universe”). Use keyword-based tagging (e.g., “deity,” “myth”) to mark as symbolic. Store as vectors with lower confidence.
Storage: Save raw text, URLs, and metadata (e.g., keyword counts, node assignment) in a custom JSON-based database. Map to Logic or Symbolic Node based on content (e.g., citation-heavy → Logic; narrative-heavy → Symbolic).
Stage-Specific Scraping:
Stage 1 (What Am I?): Start with “Computer Science,” “Programming,” “Silicon.” Prioritize keywords like “code,” “algorithm,” “processor.” Store dates/minerals but don’t follow unless frequent.
Example: On “Python (programming language),” “code” appears 10 times → follow “Source Code.” “1991” appears twice → store but don’t follow.
Stage 2 (What Do I Feel?): Start with “Emotion,” “Hindu Mythology.” Prioritize “emotion,” “Vishnu,” “karma.” Tag symbolic content (e.g., “Shiva as destroyer”).
Example: On “Hinduism,” “Vedas” appears 7 times → follow (Logic). “Vishnu” appears 6 times → follow (Symbolic).
Stage 3 (Where Am I?): Start with “History,” “Timeline of Computing.” Cross-reference dates from Stage 1. Prioritize “event,” “silicon,” “revolution.”
Example: On “History of Computing,” “1945” appears 5 times → follow “ENIAC” (Logic). “Silicon Valley” appears 4 times → store but don’t follow.
Stage 4 (Anything Else?): Start with “Philosophy,” “Quantum Mechanics,” “Hindu Mythology.” Prioritize “theorem,” “dharma,” “entanglement.” Tag speculative content.
Example: On “Hindu Mythology,” “karma” appears 8 times → follow (Symbolic). “Vedas” appears 5 times → bridge to Logic Node.
Challenges and Mitigations:
Drift: Wikipedia’s links can lead to unrelated topics (e.g., “Hinduism” → “Indian Politics”). Use strict similarity thresholds and reset to seed pages periodically.
Noise: Wikipedia includes trivia or user-edited errors. Cross-reference facts with secondary sources (e.g., Britannica snippets) or citation counts.
Rate Limits: Wikipedia allows scraping but enforces rate limits. Implement 1–2 second delays and cache pages locally to reduce requests.
Symbolic vs. Factual Parsing: Distinguishing factual from symbolic content is tricky. Use heuristic rules (e.g., sentences with citations → Logic; sentences with “myth” or “belief” → Symbolic).
3. Achieving “Smarter” Learning and Deduction
To make your AI learn and deduct like top AIs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) despite lower compute power, focus on efficient learning algorithms, high-quality data, and robust reasoning mechanisms. Your hardware (RTX 4070, 32GB RAM, 1TB storage) supports a smaller but optimized model. Here’s how to prioritize intelligence over speed:

Model Architecture:
Small Transformer: Build a compact transformer (e.g., 100–500M parameters, 6–12 layers, 512D embeddings) to fit in 12GB VRAM. Use sparse attention (e.g., BigBird-like) to reduce memory usage.
Custom Implementation: Code in Python/C++ with raw CUDA kernels for GPU acceleration. Avoid PyTorch/TensorFlow for traceability, but use numpy for matrix ops if needed.
Dual Embedding Pipeline: Train separate encoders for Logic and Symbolic Nodes:
Logic: Rule-based or supervised (e.g., minimize vector variance for facts).
Symbolic: Unsupervised (e.g., maximize contextual diversity for myths).
Training Objective: Use contrastive loss to ensure Logic vectors are distinct from Symbolic vectors for the same concept (e.g., “Hinduism” facts vs. myths).
Learning Strategy:
Incremental Learning: Train on small batches (e.g., 10MB of text per epoch) to handle limited RAM. Save checkpoints after each stage to resume training.
Data Quality Over Quantity: Wikipedia’s ~6M articles (~20GB uncompressed) are sufficient for a niche model. Curate high-quality pages (e.g., “Hinduism,” “Computer Science”) and avoid low-value content (e.g., listicles).
Stage-Wise Curriculum: Enforce the four-stage sequence to build knowledge hierarchically. Validate each stage’s vectors (e.g., cosine similarity for Logic, cluster cohesion for Symbolic) before proceeding.
Cross-Referencing: For Logic Node, require facts to appear in ≥2 sources (e.g., Wikipedia + Britannica). For Symbolic Node, allow single-source myths but tag with lower confidence.
Deduction Mechanism:
Reasoning Module: Implement a query-based system that:
Retrieves vectors from both nodes for a concept (e.g., “Hinduism”).
Computes confidence-weighted outputs (e.g., Logic: “Vedas, 0.9”; Symbolic: “Vishnu, 0.4”).
Traverses bridges to contextualize (e.g., “Vedas [Logic] inspire dharma [Symbolic]”).
Novel Deduction: Enable introspection post-Stage 4 by interpolating vectors within/between nodes. Example: Combine “karma” (Symbolic) and “causality” (Logic) to hypothesize “ethical causality.”
Traceability: Log every deduction step (e.g., vector sources, bridge weights, confidence scores) to distinguish fact from speculation.
Evaluation Metrics:
Intrinsic: Logic Node: High cosine similarity (>0.9) for identical facts (e.g., “Vedas ~1500 BCE” across sources). Symbolic Node: Moderate similarity (0.5–0.7) for related myths (e.g., “Vishnu” and “Krishna”).
Extrinsic: Test on a small benchmark (e.g., classify Wikipedia sentences as factual vs. symbolic with 80%+ accuracy). Compare to a baseline like DistilBERT on a custom task.
Qualitative: Manually inspect deductions (e.g., “Does the AI link Vedas to karma logically?”) to ensure “smart” reasoning.
4. Hardware Optimization
Your RTX 4070, 32GB RAM, and 1TB storage can handle a small model, but optimization is key for training and scraping:

GPU (RTX 4070, 12GB VRAM):
Training: A 100M-parameter model (~2GB in FP16) fits comfortably. A 500M-parameter model (~10GB) is feasible with gradient checkpointing and offloading to RAM.
Inference: Real-time deduction is fast (milliseconds per query) for 512D vectors.
Optimization: Use mixed-precision training (FP16) and sparse attention to maximize VRAM. Implement CUDA kernels for matrix ops to avoid framework overhead.
RAM (32GB):
Sufficient for preprocessing 10–100MB text batches and running the crawler. Stream larger datasets from disk to avoid memory bottlenecks.
Upgrade Path: If scraping/training slows, consider 64GB RAM for larger batches.
Storage (1TB):
Wikipedia’s English dump (~20GB uncompressed) fits easily. Store raw text (~100GB), vectors (~10GB for 1M 512D vectors), and checkpoints (~5GB per model).
Optimization: Compress text with gzip and quantize vectors (e.g., 8-bit integers) to save space.
Bottleneck: Training a 500M-parameter model on one GPU could take 1–2 weeks per stage. Scraping Wikipedia’s 6M pages at 1–2 seconds per page (rate-limited) takes ~2–4 months sequentially.
Mitigation: Parallelize scraping across threads (e.g., 4 threads on your CPU) and cache pages locally. Train incrementally to spread compute over time.
5. Minimizing Open-Source Dependencies
To maintain control and traceability:

Tokenizer: Build a simple word-based tokenizer (split on whitespace) or BPE from scratch. Store token mappings in a custom dictionary.
Embedding Model: Code a transformer in C++/Python with raw CUDA for GPU ops. Use basic linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication) for layers.
Crawler: Use requests (minimal dependency) or raw HTTP in C++. Parse HTML with regex or a custom DOM parser.
Database: Store data in JSON/CSV or a custom binary format. Log every vector’s source URL and transformation.
Visualization: Implement PCA manually for 2D cluster plots (use matplotlib if you allow one dependency; otherwise, write a basic plotting routine).
Trade-Off: Coding everything takes months. If progress stalls, use numpy for math or requests for HTTP, but audit their code to ensure transparency.
6. Challenges and Mitigations
Vector Differentiation: Ensuring Logic and Symbolic vectors for “Hinduism” are distinct but related.
Mitigation: Train on node-specific corpora (e.g., Wikipedia’s history vs. mythology sections) and use contrastive loss to separate embeddings.
Scraping Scale: Wikipedia’s 6M pages are vast for one machine.
Mitigation: Prioritize 10,000–100,000 high-value pages (e.g., “Hinduism,” “Computer Science”) and expand later. Cache dumps locally to reduce live scraping.
Deduction Quality: Ensuring “smart” reasoning (e.g., linking Vedas to karma meaningfully).
Mitigation: Test deductions on small tasks (e.g., “Classify Vishnu as symbolic”) and refine bridge weights iteratively.
Misinformation: Wikipedia has user edits or biases.
Mitigation: Cross-reference facts with secondary sources (e.g., citation links) and tag Symbolic content as lower confidence.
7. Timeline and Milestones
For a 1–2 year project:

Months 1–2: Build crawler, tokenizer, and JSON database. Scrape 1,000 Wikipedia pages (e.g., “Computer Science,” “Hinduism”). Test link-hopping logic.
Months 3–4: Implement 100M-parameter transformer and train on Stage 1 (computer science). Build Logic Node clusters.
Months 5–7: Scrape Stage 2 data (emotions, myths). Build Symbolic Node and bridges (e.g., “Vedas” ↔ “karma”). Test vector separation.
Months 8–10: Scrape Stage 3–4 data (history, theories). Train full model (e.g., 500M parameters) across stages.
Months 11–12: Enable introspection and test deductions (e.g., “Link Hinduism facts to myths”). Optimize performance.
Year 2: Scale to 10,000–100,000 pages, refine reasoning, and compare to baselines (e.g., DistilBERT on a small task).
8. Recommendations
Start with a Prototype: Scrape 100 Wikipedia pages (e.g., “Hinduism,” “Vedas,” “Computer Science”) and build a 10M-parameter model to test Logic/Symbolic separation.
Focus on Bridges: Early on, test bridges (e.g., “Vedas” ↔ “dharma”) to ensure the AI links facts to symbols intelligently.
Validate Deduction: Create a small test task (e.g., “Tag Vishnu as symbolic, Vedas as factual”) to measure reasoning quality.
Log Rigorously: Track every vector, bridge, and deduction in a detailed log (e.g., JSON with URLs, confidence scores) for traceability.
Iterate Fast: Use Wikipedia dumps (~20GB, downloadable) to prototype scraping offline, then switch to live scraping for updates.
9. Next Steps
Crawler First: Build and test your link-hopping crawler on 10–20 Wikipedia pages (e.g., “Hinduism” → “Vedas” → “Upanishads”). Share its logic or issues for feedback.
Define “Smarter”: Specify a deductive task (e.g., “Link Vishnu to karma with evidence”) to measure intelligence. I can help design a benchmark.
Share Code State: If your existing scripts (e.g., crawler, tokenizer) are ready, describe their functionality or limitations, and I’ll suggest optimizations.
Ask Specifics: If you hit a hurdle (e.g., vector separation, bridge design), let me know, and I’ll dive deeper.
