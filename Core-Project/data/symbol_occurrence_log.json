Therefore, emotions themselves arise from the person, or that which is \"imago-dei\" or Image of God in humans. In Christian thought, emotions have the potential to be controlled through reasoned reflection. That reasoned reflection also mimics God who made mind.

      "context_text": "AET primarily concerns itself with how emotional experiences at work can impact job satisfaction, performance, and other outcomes. Key concepts and principles of the Affective Events Theory include: Affective Events : AET centers on \"affective events\", which are specific events or occurrences in the workplace that trigger emotional responses in employees. These events can be positive (e.g., receiving praise or a promotion) or negative (e.g., conflicts with coworkers or work-related stressors). Emotion Generation : The theory suggests that these affective events generate emotions in employees. These emotions can be either discrete (specific emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness) or general mood states (e.g., feeling generally positive or negative). Emotion-Driven Outcomes : AET posits that emotions generated by affective events at work have consequences for employee attitudes and behaviors.",

      "context_text": "In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals. Genetics [ edit ] Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems.",
