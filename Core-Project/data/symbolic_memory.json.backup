The resulting methods were researched in the mid-20th century and dubbed Lean by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in The Machine that Changed the World [ 6 ] and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in Lean Thinking (1996). Japan: the origins of Lean [ edit ] W. Edwards Deming The adoption of just-in-time manufacturing in Japan and many other early forms of Lean can be traced back directly to the US-backed Reconstruction and Occupation of Japan following WWII. During this time, an American economist, W. Edwards Deming , and an American statistician, Walter A. Shewhart , promoted some of the earliest modern manufacturing methods and management philosophies they developed in the late '30s and early '40s.",

    "text": "[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In addition to Deming's critical influence in Japan, most local companies were in a position where they needed an immediate solution to the extreme situation they were living in after World War II. American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

    "text": "Mixed-signal ICs process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a typical mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] His learning RNN was republished by John Hopfield in 1982. [ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971.

American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Predecessors [ edit ] Before the development of printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic circuits were wired point-to-point on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering , or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.",

When the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the distributed-element model . Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant characteristic impedance , and the impedances at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line. Circuits designed according to this approach are distributed-element circuits . Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.

The academic study of symbols is called semiotics . In the arts, symbolism is the use of a concrete element to represent a more abstract idea. In cartography , an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map. Etymology [ edit ] The word symbol derives from the late Middle French masculine noun symbole , which appeared around 1380 in a theological sense signifying a formula used in the Roman Catholic Church as a sort of synonym for 'the credo'; by extension in the early Renaissance it came to mean 'a maxim' or 'the external sign of a sacrament'; these meanings were lost in secular contexts.",

    "text": "It was during the Renaissance in the mid-16th century that the word took on the meaning that is dominant today, that of 'a natural fact or object evoking by its form or its nature an association of ideas with something abstract or absent'; this appears, for example, in François Rabelais , Le Quart Livre , in 1552. [ 1 ] This French word derives from Latin, where both the masculine noun symbolus and the neuter noun symbolum refer to \"a mark or sign as a means of recognition.\" [ 2 ] The Latin word derives from Ancient Greek : σύμβολον symbolon , from a verb meaning 'put together', 'compare', alluding to the Classical practice of breaking a piece of ceramic in two and giving one half to the person who would receive a future message, and one half to the person who would send it:  when the two fit perfectly together, the receiver could be sure that the messenger bearing it did indeed also carry a genuine message from the intended person.",

[ 3 ] Heinrich Zimmer gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols. Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these, a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own.\" [ 6 ] In the book Signs and Symbols , it is stated that A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea – a deeper indicator of universal truth.",

    "text": "[ 7 ] Symbols and semiotics [ edit ] Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account the interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues. Semiotics is linked with linguistics and psychology. Semioticians not only study what a symbol implies but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society. For example, symbols can cause confusion in translation when the same symbol means different things in the source and target languages. A potential error documented in survey translation is the symbol of \"x\" used to denote \"yes\" when marking a response in the English language surveys, but \"x\" usually means \"no\" in the Chinese convention. [ 8 ] Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both denotation and connotation .",

    "text": "Psychoanalysis, rhetoric, and archetypes [ edit ] An alternative definition of symbol , distinguishing it from the term sign was proposed by Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung . In his studies on what is now called Jungian archetypes , a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted a sign with a symbol : something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise. An example of a symbol in this sense is Christ as a symbol of the archetype called self . [ 9 ] Kenneth Burke described Homo sapiens as a \"symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal\" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of the symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling.",

Clift argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling. [ 10 ] William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfill psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as \"the hero\", \"the princess\" and \"the witch\" have remained popular for centuries.

Isomorphic symbols blend in with the surrounding cultural environment such that they enable individuals and organizations to conform to their surroundings and evade social and political scrutiny. Examples of symbols with isomorphic value include wearing a professional dress during business meetings, shaking hands to greet others in the West, or bowing to greet others in the East. A single symbol can carry multiple distinct meanings such that it provides multiple types of symbolic value. [ 12 ] Paul Tillich [ edit ] Paul Tillich argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die. There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.",

[ 13 ] Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol. When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the \"symbol is taken for reality.\" The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality that are otherwise inaccessible.

Various synonyms exist for this type of symbol, based on specific genre , artistic medium , or domain: visual symbol , literary symbol , poetic symbol , etc. Examples [ edit ] Some symbolism appears commonly in works of poetry, fiction, or visual art. For instance, often, a rose symbolizes beauty; a lion symbolizes strength; and certain colors symbolize national flags and thus, by extension, certain nations. [ 3 ] The latter is specifically an example of color symbolism . While symbols can recur within or even across cultures, other symbols recur only in the context of one particular work. For instance, scholars widely consider references to blood in the play Macbeth by William Shakespeare to be symbolism for the main character's violent behavior and his accompanying guilt.",

    "text": "Mixed-signal ICs process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a typical mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

    "text": "History [ edit ] Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford documented their observations relating to these topics, and Shigeo Shingo and Taiichi Ohno applied their enhanced thoughts on the subject at Toyota in the late 1940s after World War II. The resulting methods were researched in the mid-20th century and dubbed Lean by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in The Machine that Changed the World [ 6 ] and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in Lean Thinking (1996). Japan: the origins of Lean [ edit ] W. Edwards Deming The adoption of just-in-time manufacturing in Japan and many other early forms of Lean can be traced back directly to the US-backed Reconstruction and Occupation of Japan following WWII. During this time, an American economist, W. Edwards Deming , and an American statistician, Walter A. Shewhart , promoted some of the earliest modern manufacturing methods and management philosophies they developed in the late '30s and early '40s.",

    "text": "[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In addition to Deming's critical influence in Japan, most local companies were in a position where they needed an immediate solution to the extreme situation they were living in after World War II. American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

Well, from the comments, I'd say that we expect an input like \"1 + 2 * 3 * 4 + ( 5 + 6 + 7 ) * ( 8 + 9 ) \". First step splits it on spaces into a list, and appends [\";\"]. Then the result is evaluated as a sum of sub expressions. That means we should work from left to right, evaluate sub expressions, and sum the results together.

Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose Elements , widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, [ 16 ] introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.

It guides the development of new technologies, economic progress, and addresses challenges in various scientific fields and industries. The history of Applied Mathematics continually demonstrates the importance of mathematics in human progress. Divisions [ edit ] Fluid mechanics is often considered a branch of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering. Today, the term \"applied mathematics\" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as cryptography ), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics per se . There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are.",

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Ancient Greece [ edit ] Ancient Greek mathematicians were amongst the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. Plato helped to create the gap between \"arithmetic\", now called number theory , and \"logistic\", now called arithmetic . Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who \"must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops\" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers \"because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being.\"",

Then the result is evaluated as a sum of sub expressions. That means we should work from left to right, evaluate sub expressions, and sum the results together.

Thus the term unifying theory is more like a sociological term used to study the actions of mathematicians. It may assume nothing conjectural that would be analogous to an undiscovered scientific link. There is really no cognate within mathematics to such concepts as Proto-World in linguistics or the Gaia hypothesis . Nonetheless there have been several episodes within the history of mathematics in which sets of individual theorems were found to be special cases of a single unifying result, or in which a single perspective about how to proceed when developing an area of mathematics could be applied fruitfully to multiple branches of the subject.

    "text": "Geometrical theories [ edit ] A well-known example was the development of analytic geometry , which in the hands of mathematicians such as Descartes and Fermat showed that many theorems about curves and surfaces of special types could be stated in algebraic language (then new), each of which could then be proved using the same techniques. That is, the theorems were very similar algebraically, even if the geometrical interpretations were distinct. In 1859, Arthur Cayley initiated a unification of metric geometries through use of the Cayley-Klein metrics . Later Felix Klein used such metrics to provide a foundation for non-Euclidean geometry . In 1872, Felix Klein noted that the many branches of geometry which had been developed during the 19th century ( affine geometry , projective geometry , hyperbolic geometry , etc.) could all be treated in a uniform way. He did this by considering the groups under which the geometric objects were invariant.",

In most cases, mathematical objects under study can be defined (albeit non-canonically) as sets or, more informally, as sets with additional structure such as an addition operation. Set theory now serves as a lingua franca for the development of mathematical themes. Bourbaki [ edit ] The cause of axiomatic development was taken up in earnest by the Bourbaki group of mathematicians. Taken to its extreme, this attitude was thought to demand mathematics developed in its greatest generality. One started from the most general axioms, and then specialized, for example, by introducing modules over commutative rings , and limiting to vector spaces over the real numbers only when absolutely necessary. The story proceeded in this fashion, even when the specializations were the theorems of primary interest.",

Saunders Mac Lane proposed that any concept with enough 'ubiquity' (occurring in various branches of mathematics) deserved isolating and studying in its own right. Category theory is arguably better adapted to that end than any other current approach. The disadvantages of relying on so-called abstract nonsense are a certain blandness and abstraction in the sense of breaking away from the roots in concrete problems. Nevertheless, the methods of category theory have steadily advanced in acceptance, in numerous areas (from D-modules to categorical logic ). Uniting theories [ edit ] On a less grand scale, similarities between sets of results in two different branches of mathematics raise the question of whether a unifying framework exists that could explain the parallels.",

History [ edit ] George Dantzig worked on planning methods for the US Army Air Force during World War II using a desk calculator . During 1946, his colleague challenged him to mechanize the planning process to distract him from taking another job. Dantzig formulated the problem as linear inequalities inspired by the work of Wassily Leontief , however, at that time he didn't include an objective as part of his formulation. Without an objective, a vast number of solutions can be feasible, and therefore to find the \"best\" feasible solution, military-specified \"ground rules\" must be used that describe how goals can be achieved as opposed to specifying a goal itself. Dantzig's core insight was to realize that most such ground rules can be translated into a linear objective function that needs to be maximized.",

    "text": "The next step is to generate a second generation population of solutions from those selected, through a combination of genetic operators : crossover (also called recombination), and mutation . For each new solution to be produced, a pair of \"parent\" solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a \"child\" solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its \"parents\". New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated. Although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more \"biology inspired\", some research [ 7 ] [ 8 ] suggests that more than two \"parents\" generate higher quality chromosomes. These processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation.",

I was kind of struggling with a couple of the problems on my symbolic logic homework, and any help/hints/etc. would be very much appreciated! The same symbolizations are used as in Klenk's \"Understanding Symbolic Logic\" book: • = dot, meaning \"and\", as in p • q v = wedge, meaning \"either/or\", as in p v q ≡ = triple bar, meaning \"if and only if\", as in p ≡ q ~ = tilde, meaning \"not\", as in ~p ⊃ = horseshoe, meaning \"if ___, then ___\", as in p ⊃ q",

    "text": "Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of \"blubber\" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of \"blubber\" was created by the man through various kinds of learning . Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from Sigmund Freud 's work on condensation and displacement , further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the theory of dreams but also to \"normal symbol systems\". He says they are related through \"substitution\", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning. [ clarification needed ] In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information.",

    "text": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Symbolism (arts) ) Representation that conveys deeper meaning \"Symbolism (arts)\" redirects here. For the late 19th-century French and Belgian social movement of poets and other artists, see Symbolism (movement) . In works of art , literature , and narrative , a symbol is a concrete element like an object, character, image, situation, or action that suggests or hints at abstract, deeper, or non-literal meanings or ideas. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The use of symbols artistically is symbolism . In literature, such as novels, plays, and poems, symbolism goes beyond just the literal written words on a page, since writing itself is also inherently a system of symbols. Artistic symbols may be intentionally built into a work by its creator, which in the case of narratives can make symbolism a deliberate narrative device .",

The first European solution is found in a joint work in 1658 by John Wallis and Lord Brouncker ; in 1668, a shorter solution was given in an edition of a third mathematician's work by Pell; see ref. [ 27 ] The first rigorous proof may be due to Lagrange . The misnomer apparently came about when Euler confused Brouncker and Pell; see [ 28 ] for an extensive account of the history of this equation. Set theory [ edit ] Zorn's lemma is named for Max Zorn . Much work on the theorem now known as Zorn's lemma, and on several closely related formulations such as the Hausdorff maximal principle , was done between 1907 and 1940 by Zorn, Brouwer , Hausdorff , Kuratowski , R. L. Moore , and others. But the particular theorem now known as \"Zorn's lemma\" was never proved by Zorn, and in any event Zorn's results were anticipated by Kuratowski.",

For each new solution to be produced, a pair of \"parent\" solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a \"child\" solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its \"parents\". New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated. Although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more \"biology inspired\", some research [ 7 ] [ 8 ] suggests that more than two \"parents\" generate higher quality chromosomes. These processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation.",

The utility of Apostolico–Giancarlo is to speed up the match-checking operation at any index. With Boyer–Moore, finding an occurrence of P in T requires that all n characters of P be explicitly matched. For certain patterns and texts, this is very inefficient – a simple example is when both pattern and text consist of the same repeated character, in which case Boyer–Moore runs in O( nm ) , where m is the length in characters of T . Apostolico–Giancarlo speeds this up by recording the number of characters matched at the alignments of T in a table, which is combined with data gathered during the pre-processing of P to avoid redundant equality checking for sequences of characters that are known to match. It can be seen as a generalization of the Galil rule . References [ edit ] Apostolico, Alberto; Giancarlo, Raffaele (1986).",

At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes f ( n ) = g ( n ) + h ( n ) {\\displaystyle f(n)=g(n)+h(n)} where n is the next node on the path, g ( n ) is the cost of the path from the start node to n , and h ( n ) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. The heuristic function is problem-specific. If the heuristic function is admissible – meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the goal – A* is guaranteed to return a least-cost path from start to goal.",

If that value can be used to compute the next hash value in constant time, then computing successive hash values will be fast. The trick can be exploited using a rolling hash . A rolling hash is a hash function specially designed to enable this operation. A trivial (but not very good) rolling hash function just adds the values of each character in the substring. This rolling hash formula can compute the next hash value from the previous value in constant time: s[i+1..i+m] = s[i..i+m-1] - s[i] + s[i+m] This simple function works, but will result in statement 5 being executed more often than other more sophisticated rolling hash functions such as those discussed in the next section.

It is understood that NP ⊆ P NP , but the question of whether NP NP , P NP , NP, and P are equal remains tentative at best. It is believed they are different, and this leads to the definition of the polynomial hierarchy . Oracle machines are useful for investigating the relationship between complexity classes P and NP , by considering the relationship between P A and NP A for an oracle A. In particular, it has been shown there exist languages A and B such that P A =NP A and P B ≠NP B . [ 4 ] The fact the P = NP question relativizes both ways is taken as evidence that answering this question is difficult, because a proof technique that relativizes (i.e., unaffected by the addition of an oracle) will not answer the P = NP question.

On each day, the chance that a patient tells the doctor \"I feel normal\", \"I feel cold\", or \"I feel dizzy\", depends only on the patient's health condition on that day. The observations (normal, cold, dizzy) along with the hidden states (healthy, fever) form a hidden Markov model (HMM). From past experience, the probabilities of this model have been estimated as: init = {\"Healthy\": 0.6, \"Fever\": 0.4}\ntrans = {\n    \"Healthy\": {\"Healthy\": 0.7, \"Fever\": 0.3},\n    \"Fever\": {\"Healthy\": 0.4, \"Fever\": 0.6},\n}\nemit = {\n    \"Healthy\": {\"normal\": 0.5, \"cold\": 0.4, \"dizzy\": 0.1},\n    \"Fever\": {\"normal\": 0.1, \"cold\": 0.3, \"dizzy\": 0.6},\n} In this code, init represents the doctor's belief about how likely the patient is to be healthy initially.",

The probabilities for each of the following days can be calculated from the previous day directly.

In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with T E X , which is currently used for all volumes. Another characteristic of the volumes is the variation in the difficulty of the exercises including a numerical rating varying from 0 to 50, where 0 is trivial, and 50 is an open question in contemporary research. Bounty for finding errors [ edit ] The offer of a so-called Knuth reward check worth \"one hexadecimal dollar\" (100 HEX base 16 cents, in decimal , is $2.56) for any errors found, and the correction of these errors in subsequent printings, has contributed to the highly polished and still-authoritative nature of the work, long after its first publication.",

    "text": "Base case [ edit ] A recursive function definition has one or more base cases , meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result trivially (without recurring), and one or more recursive cases , meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself). For example, the factorial function can be defined recursively by the equations 0! = 1 and, for all n > 0 , n ! = n ( n − 1)! . Neither equation by itself constitutes a complete definition; the first is the base case, and the second is the recursive case. Because the base case breaks the chain of recursion, it is sometimes also called the \"terminating case\". The job of the recursive cases can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones. In a properly designed recursive function, with each recursive call, the input problem must be simplified in such a way that eventually the base case must be reached.",

    "text": "The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function. History [ edit ] George Dantzig worked on planning methods for the US Army Air Force during World War II using a desk calculator . During 1946, his colleague challenged him to mechanize the planning process to distract him from taking another job. Dantzig formulated the problem as linear inequalities inspired by the work of Wassily Leontief , however, at that time he didn't include an objective as part of his formulation. Without an objective, a vast number of solutions can be feasible, and therefore to find the \"best\" feasible solution, military-specified \"ground rules\" must be used that describe how goals can be achieved as opposed to specifying a goal itself. Dantzig's core insight was to realize that most such ground rules can be translated into a linear objective function that needs to be maximized.",

    "text": "In this way, all lower bound constraints may be changed to non-negativity restrictions. Second, for each remaining inequality constraint, a new variable, called a slack variable , is introduced to change the constraint to an equality constraint. This variable represents the difference between the two sides of the inequality and is assumed to be non-negative. For example, the inequalities x 2 + 2 x 3 ≤ 3 − x 4 + 3 x 5 ≥ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}x_{2}+2x_{3}&\\leq 3\\\\-x_{4}+3x_{5}&\\geq 2\\end{aligned}}} are replaced with x 2 + 2 x 3 + s 1 = 3 − x 4 + 3 x 5 − s 2 = 2 s 1 , s 2 ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}x_{2}+2x_{3}+s_{1}&=3\\\\-x_{4}+3x_{5}-s_{2}&=2\\\\s_{1},\\,s_{2}&\\geq 0\\end{aligned}}} It is much easier to perform algebraic manipulation on inequalities in this form. In inequalities where ≥ appears such as the second one, some authors refer to the variable introduced as a surplus variable . Third, each unrestricted variable is eliminated from the linear program.",

    "text": "While trying to color a map of the counties of England, Francis Guthrie postulated the four color conjecture , noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color. Guthrie's brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher Augustus De Morgan at University College , who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852. Arthur Cayley raised the problem at a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society. [ 1 ] In 1890, Percy John Heawood pointed out that Kempe's argument was wrong.",

Input-sensitive profiler [ edit ] Input-sensitive profilers [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] add a further dimension to flat or call-graph profilers by relating performance measures to features of the input workloads, such as input size or input values. They generate charts that characterize how an application's performance scales as a function of its input. Data granularity in profiler types [ edit ] Profilers, which are also programs themselves, analyze target programs by collecting information on the target program's execution. Based on their data granularity, which depends upon how profilers collect information, they are classified as event-based or statistical profilers. Profilers interrupt program execution to collect information. Those interrupts can limit time measurement resolution, which implies that timing results should be taken with a grain of salt.",

The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function. History [ edit ] George Dantzig worked on planning methods for the US Army Air Force during World War II using a desk calculator . During 1946, his colleague challenged him to mechanize the planning process to distract him from taking another job. Dantzig formulated the problem as linear inequalities inspired by the work of Wassily Leontief , however, at that time he didn't include an objective as part of his formulation. Without an objective, a vast number of solutions can be feasible, and therefore to find the \"best\" feasible solution, military-specified \"ground rules\" must be used that describe how goals can be achieved as opposed to specifying a goal itself.",

Second, for each remaining inequality constraint, a new variable, called a slack variable , is introduced to change the constraint to an equality constraint. This variable represents the difference between the two sides of the inequality and is assumed to be non-negative. For example, the inequalities x 2 + 2 x 3 ≤ 3 − x 4 + 3 x 5 ≥ 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}x_{2}+2x_{3}&\\leq 3\\\\-x_{4}+3x_{5}&\\geq 2\\end{aligned}}} are replaced with x 2 + 2 x 3 + s 1 = 3 − x 4 + 3 x 5 − s 2 = 2 s 1 , s 2 ≥ 0 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}x_{2}+2x_{3}+s_{1}&=3\\\\-x_{4}+3x_{5}-s_{2}&=2\\\\s_{1},\\,s_{2}&\\geq 0\\end{aligned}}} It is much easier to perform algebraic manipulation on inequalities in this form.

A small fraction of the colony constantly searches the environment looking for new flower patches. These scout bees move randomly in the area surrounding the hive, evaluating the profitability (net energy yield) of the food sources encountered. [ 7 ] When they return to the hive, the scouts deposit the food harvested. Those individuals that found a highly profitable food source go to an area in the hive called the “dance floor”, and perform a ritual known as the waggle dance .

For each new solution to be produced, a pair of \"parent\" solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a \"child\" solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its \"parents\". New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated. Although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more \"biology inspired\", some research [ 7 ] [ 8 ] suggests that more than two \"parents\" generate higher quality chromosomes.

Do all of the agents construct their own plans separately, or are the plans constructed centrally for all agents? The simplest possible planning problem, known as the Classical Planning Problem, is determined by: a unique known initial state, durationless actions, deterministic actions, which can be taken only one at a time, and a single agent. Since the initial state is known unambiguously, and all actions are deterministic, the state of the world after any sequence of actions can be accurately predicted, and the question of observability is irrelevant for classical planning. Further, plans can be defined as sequences of actions, because it is always known in advance which actions will be needed. With nondeterministic actions or other events outside the control of the agent, the possible executions form a tree, and plans have to determine the appropriate actions for every node of the tree.",

Guthrie's brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher Augustus De Morgan at University College , who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852. Arthur Cayley raised the problem at a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society.

The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G is called its chromatic number , and is often denoted χ( G ) . [ 4 ] Sometimes γ( G ) is used, since χ( G ) is also used to denote the Euler characteristic of a graph. [ 5 ] A graph that can be assigned a (proper) k -coloring is k -colorable , and it is k -chromatic if its chromatic number is exactly k . A subset of vertices assigned to the same color is called a color class ; every such class forms an independent set . Thus, a k -coloring is the same as a partition of the vertex set into k independent sets, and the terms k -partite and k -colorable have the same meaning.

The empty graph E 3 (red) admits a 1-coloring; the complete graph K 3 (blue) admits a 3-coloring; the other graphs admit a 2-coloring.",

    "text": "The index variable is the depth-first search node number counter. S is the node stack, which starts out empty and stores the history of nodes explored but not yet committed to a strongly connected component. This is not the normal depth-first search stack, as nodes are not popped as the search returns up the tree; they are only popped when an entire strongly connected component has been found. The outermost loop searches each node that has not yet been visited, ensuring that nodes which are not reachable from the first node are still eventually traversed. The function strongconnect performs a single depth-first search of the graph, finding all successors from the node v , and reporting all strongly connected components of that subgraph. When each node finishes recursing, if its lowlink is still set to its index, then it is the root node of a strongly connected component, formed by all of the nodes above it on the stack.",

The resulting score for the cell is the highest of the three candidate scores. Given there is no 'top' or 'top-left' cells for the first row only the existing cell to the left can be used to calculate the score of each cell. Hence −1 is added for each shift to the right as this represents an indel from the previous score. This results in the first row being 0, −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, −6, −7. The same applies to the first column as only the existing score above each cell can be used. Thus the resulting table is: G C A T G C G 0 −1 −2 −3 −4 −5 −6 −7 G −1 A −2 T −3 T −4 A −5 C −6 A −7 The first case with existing scores in all 3 directions is the intersection of our first letters (in this case G and G).

If the character does not exist as a child, we can find the next longest suffix (following the blue arc again) and then search for the character. We can do this until we either find the character (as child of a node) or we reach the root (which will always be a suffix of every string). There is a green \"dictionary suffix\" arc from each node to the next node in the dictionary that can be reached by following blue arcs. For example, there is a green arc from (bca) to (a) because (a) is the first node in the dictionary (i.e. a blue node) that is reached when following the blue arcs to (ca) and then on to (a). The green arcs can be computed in linear time by repeatedly traversing blue arcs until a blue node is found, and memoizing this information.",

    "text": "For speed, the hash must be computed in constant time. The trick is the variable hs already contains the previous hash value of s[i..i+m-1] . If that value can be used to compute the next hash value in constant time, then computing successive hash values will be fast. The trick can be exploited using a rolling hash . A rolling hash is a hash function specially designed to enable this operation. A trivial (but not very good) rolling hash function just adds the values of each character in the substring. This rolling hash formula can compute the next hash value from the previous value in constant time: s[i+1..i+m] = s[i..i+m-1] - s[i] + s[i+m] This simple function works, but will result in statement 5 being executed more often than other more sophisticated rolling hash functions such as those discussed in the next section. Good performance requires a good hashing function for the encountered data.",
