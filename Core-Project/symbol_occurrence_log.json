Therefore, emotions themselves arise from the person, or that which is \"imago-dei\" or Image of God in humans. In Christian thought, emotions have the potential to be controlled through reasoned reflection. That reasoned reflection also mimics God who made mind.

      "context_text": "AET primarily concerns itself with how emotional experiences at work can impact job satisfaction, performance, and other outcomes. Key concepts and principles of the Affective Events Theory include: Affective Events : AET centers on \"affective events\", which are specific events or occurrences in the workplace that trigger emotional responses in employees. These events can be positive (e.g., receiving praise or a promotion) or negative (e.g., conflicts with coworkers or work-related stressors). Emotion Generation : The theory suggests that these affective events generate emotions in employees. These emotions can be either discrete (specific emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness) or general mood states (e.g., feeling generally positive or negative). Emotion-Driven Outcomes : AET posits that emotions generated by affective events at work have consequences for employee attitudes and behaviors.",

      "context_text": "In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals. Genetics [ edit ] Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems.",

For example, it does not fully explain baryon asymmetry , incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity , or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy . The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology . It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.",

The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs ‚Äî to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings. Function problems [ edit ] A function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function ) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem ‚Äîthat is, the output is not just yes or no. Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem . It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems.",

But in evolutionary history, maximizing the fitness specification gave rise to goal-directed agents, humans, who do not directly pursue inclusive genetic fitness. Instead, they pursue goals that correlate with genetic fitness in the ancestral \"training\" environment: nutrition, sex, and so on. The human environment has changed: a distribution shift has occurred. They continue to pursue the same emergent goals, but this no longer maximizes genetic fitness. The taste for sugary food (an emergent goal) was originally aligned with inclusive fitness, but it now leads to overeating and health problems. Sexual desire originally led humans to have more offspring, but they now use contraception when offspring are undesired, decoupling sex from genetic fitness.",

Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include: production process models and data and generic manufacturing systems configurations; machinery and equipment specifications, and vendor catalogs; recommended methods, practices, algorithms, etc., and benchmarking data; typical plant/system layouts, cost estimation models, labor rates, other cost data and budget templates, time standards, industrial standards, project plans, and laws/government regulations. These on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others. Another critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which\ncan best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost \"off-the-shelf\" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software.",
