The resulting methods were researched in the mid-20th century and dubbed Lean by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in The Machine that Changed the World [ 6 ] and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in Lean Thinking (1996). Japan: the origins of Lean [ edit ] W. Edwards Deming The adoption of just-in-time manufacturing in Japan and many other early forms of Lean can be traced back directly to the US-backed Reconstruction and Occupation of Japan following WWII. During this time, an American economist, W. Edwards Deming , and an American statistician, Walter A. Shewhart , promoted some of the earliest modern manufacturing methods and management philosophies they developed in the late '30s and early '40s.",

    "text": "[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In addition to Deming's critical influence in Japan, most local companies were in a position where they needed an immediate solution to the extreme situation they were living in after World War II. American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

    "text": "Mixed-signal ICs process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a typical mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] His learning RNN was republished by John Hopfield in 1982. [ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971.

American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Predecessors [ edit ] Before the development of printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic circuits were wired point-to-point on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering , or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.",

When the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the distributed-element model . Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant characteristic impedance , and the impedances at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line. Circuits designed according to this approach are distributed-element circuits . Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.

The academic study of symbols is called semiotics . In the arts, symbolism is the use of a concrete element to represent a more abstract idea. In cartography , an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map. Etymology [ edit ] The word symbol derives from the late Middle French masculine noun symbole , which appeared around 1380 in a theological sense signifying a formula used in the Roman Catholic Church as a sort of synonym for 'the credo'; by extension in the early Renaissance it came to mean 'a maxim' or 'the external sign of a sacrament'; these meanings were lost in secular contexts.",

    "text": "It was during the Renaissance in the mid-16th century that the word took on the meaning that is dominant today, that of 'a natural fact or object evoking by its form or its nature an association of ideas with something abstract or absent'; this appears, for example, in François Rabelais , Le Quart Livre , in 1552. [ 1 ] This French word derives from Latin, where both the masculine noun symbolus and the neuter noun symbolum refer to \"a mark or sign as a means of recognition.\" [ 2 ] The Latin word derives from Ancient Greek : σύμβολον symbolon , from a verb meaning 'put together', 'compare', alluding to the Classical practice of breaking a piece of ceramic in two and giving one half to the person who would receive a future message, and one half to the person who would send it:  when the two fit perfectly together, the receiver could be sure that the messenger bearing it did indeed also carry a genuine message from the intended person.",

[ 3 ] Heinrich Zimmer gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols. Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these, a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own.\" [ 6 ] In the book Signs and Symbols , it is stated that A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea – a deeper indicator of universal truth.",

    "text": "[ 7 ] Symbols and semiotics [ edit ] Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account the interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues. Semiotics is linked with linguistics and psychology. Semioticians not only study what a symbol implies but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society. For example, symbols can cause confusion in translation when the same symbol means different things in the source and target languages. A potential error documented in survey translation is the symbol of \"x\" used to denote \"yes\" when marking a response in the English language surveys, but \"x\" usually means \"no\" in the Chinese convention. [ 8 ] Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both denotation and connotation .",

    "text": "Psychoanalysis, rhetoric, and archetypes [ edit ] An alternative definition of symbol , distinguishing it from the term sign was proposed by Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung . In his studies on what is now called Jungian archetypes , a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted a sign with a symbol : something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise. An example of a symbol in this sense is Christ as a symbol of the archetype called self . [ 9 ] Kenneth Burke described Homo sapiens as a \"symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal\" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of the symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling.",

Clift argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling. [ 10 ] William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfill psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as \"the hero\", \"the princess\" and \"the witch\" have remained popular for centuries.

Isomorphic symbols blend in with the surrounding cultural environment such that they enable individuals and organizations to conform to their surroundings and evade social and political scrutiny. Examples of symbols with isomorphic value include wearing a professional dress during business meetings, shaking hands to greet others in the West, or bowing to greet others in the East. A single symbol can carry multiple distinct meanings such that it provides multiple types of symbolic value. [ 12 ] Paul Tillich [ edit ] Paul Tillich argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die. There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.",

[ 13 ] Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol. When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the \"symbol is taken for reality.\" The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality that are otherwise inaccessible.

Various synonyms exist for this type of symbol, based on specific genre , artistic medium , or domain: visual symbol , literary symbol , poetic symbol , etc. Examples [ edit ] Some symbolism appears commonly in works of poetry, fiction, or visual art. For instance, often, a rose symbolizes beauty; a lion symbolizes strength; and certain colors symbolize national flags and thus, by extension, certain nations. [ 3 ] The latter is specifically an example of color symbolism . While symbols can recur within or even across cultures, other symbols recur only in the context of one particular work. For instance, scholars widely consider references to blood in the play Macbeth by William Shakespeare to be symbolism for the main character's violent behavior and his accompanying guilt.",

    "text": "Mixed-signal ICs process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a typical mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal ICs are often used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are essential components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have digital amplifiers. Any analog signal can be digitized using a very basic ADC, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these are mixed-signal ICs. Mixed-signal ICs are more difficult to design and manufacture than analog-only or digital-only integrated circuits. For example, an efficient mixed-signal IC may have its digital and analog components share a common power supply. However, analog and digital components have very different power needs and consumption characteristics, which makes this a non-trivial goal in chip design.",

    "text": "History [ edit ] Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford documented their observations relating to these topics, and Shigeo Shingo and Taiichi Ohno applied their enhanced thoughts on the subject at Toyota in the late 1940s after World War II. The resulting methods were researched in the mid-20th century and dubbed Lean by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in The Machine that Changed the World [ 6 ] and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in Lean Thinking (1996). Japan: the origins of Lean [ edit ] W. Edwards Deming The adoption of just-in-time manufacturing in Japan and many other early forms of Lean can be traced back directly to the US-backed Reconstruction and Occupation of Japan following WWII. During this time, an American economist, W. Edwards Deming , and an American statistician, Walter A. Shewhart , promoted some of the earliest modern manufacturing methods and management philosophies they developed in the late '30s and early '40s.",

    "text": "[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In addition to Deming's critical influence in Japan, most local companies were in a position where they needed an immediate solution to the extreme situation they were living in after World War II. American supply chain specialist Gerhard Plenert has offered four quite vague reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding (of economy, infrastructure, industry, political, and social-emotional stability): Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes.",

I was kind of struggling with a couple of the problems on my symbolic logic homework, and any help/hints/etc. would be very much appreciated! The same symbolizations are used as in Klenk's \"Understanding Symbolic Logic\" book: • = dot, meaning \"and\", as in p • q v = wedge, meaning \"either/or\", as in p v q ≡ = triple bar, meaning \"if and only if\", as in p ≡ q ~ = tilde, meaning \"not\", as in ~p ⊃ = horseshoe, meaning \"if ___, then ___\", as in p ⊃ q",

In addition, the symbol of \"blubber\" was created by the man through various kinds of learning . Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from Sigmund Freud 's work on condensation and displacement , further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the theory of dreams but also to \"normal symbol systems\". He says they are related through \"substitution\", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning. [ clarification needed ] In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information.",

    "text": "Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Symbolism (arts) ) Representation that conveys deeper meaning \"Symbolism (arts)\" redirects here. For the late 19th-century French and Belgian social movement of poets and other artists, see Symbolism (movement) . In works of art , literature , and narrative , a symbol is a concrete element like an object, character, image, situation, or action that suggests or hints at abstract, deeper, or non-literal meanings or ideas. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The use of symbols artistically is symbolism . In literature, such as novels, plays, and poems, symbolism goes beyond just the literal written words on a page, since writing itself is also inherently a system of symbols. Artistic symbols may be intentionally built into a work by its creator, which in the case of narratives can make symbolism a deliberate narrative device .",
