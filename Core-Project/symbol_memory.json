In many synapses, the presynaptic part is located on the terminals of axons and the postsynaptic part is located on a dendrite or soma. Astrocytes also exchange information with the synaptic neurons, responding to synaptic activity and, in turn, regulating neurotransmission.[10] Synapses (at least chemical synapses) are stabilized in position by synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs)[1] projecting from both the pre- and post-synaptic neuron and sticking together where they overlap; SAMs may also assist in the generation and functioning of synapses.[12] Moreover, SAMs coordinate the formation of synapses, with various types working together to achieve the remarkable specificity of synapses.[11][13] In essence, SAMs function in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, likely serving as the mediator for signal transmission.[11]Many mental illnesses are thought to be caused by synaptopathy.",

The reversal potential for Cl- in many neurons is quite negative, nearly equal to the resting potential. Opening Cl- channels tends to buffer the membrane potential, but this effect is countered when the membrane starts to depolarize, allowing more negatively charged Cl- ions to enter the cell. Consequently, it becomes more difficult to depolarize the membrane and excite the cell when Cl- channels are open. Similar effects result from the opening of K+ channels. The significance of inhibitory neurotransmitters is evident from the effects of toxins that impede their activity. For instance, strychnine binds to glycine receptors, blocking the action of glycine and leading to muscle spasms, convulsions, and death.[26]",
