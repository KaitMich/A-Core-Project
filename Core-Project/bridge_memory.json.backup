[ e ] There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ]",

Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.

Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act .",

    "text": "Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples.",

    "text": "[ 20 ] As of 2014, a number of memory products such as High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and the Hybrid Memory Cube have been launched that implement 3D IC stacking with TSVs. There are a number of key stacking approaches being implemented and explored. These include die-to-die, die-to-wafer, and wafer-to-wafer. Die-to-Die Electronic components are built on multiple die, which are then aligned and bonded. Thinning and TSV creation may be done before or after bonding. One advantage of die-to-die is that each component die can be tested first, so that one bad die does not ruin an entire stack. [ 21 ] Moreover, each die in the 3D IC can be binned beforehand, so that they can be mixed and matched to optimize power consumption and performance (e.g. matching multiple dice from the low power process corner for a mobile application). Die-to-Wafer Electronic components are built on two semiconductor wafers.",

As in the wafer-on-wafer method, thinning and TSV creation are performed either before or after bonding. Additional die may be added to the stacks before dicing. [ 22 ] Wafer-to-Wafer Electronic components are built on two or more semiconductor wafers , which are then aligned, bonded, and diced into 3D ICs. Each wafer may be thinned before or after bonding. Vertical connections are either built into the wafers before bonding or else created in the stack after bonding. These \" through-silicon vias \" (TSVs) pass through the silicon substrate(s) between active layers and/or between an active layer and an external bond pad. Wafer-to-wafer bonding can reduce yields, since if any 1 of N chips in a 3D IC are defective, the entire 3D IC will be defective.",

Benefits [ edit ] While traditional CMOS scaling processes improves signal propagation speed, scaling from current manufacturing and chip-design technologies is becoming more difficult and costly, in part because of power-density constraints, and in part because interconnects do not become faster while transistors do. [ 23 ] 3D ICs address the scaling challenge by stacking 2D dies and connecting them in the 3rd dimension. This promises to speed up communication between layered chips, compared to planar layout. [ 24 ] 3D ICs promise many significant benefits, including: Footprint More functionality fits into a small space.",

However, Deming and Shewhart failed to convince other US manufacturers to apply these \"radical\" methods. After the war, Deming was assigned to participate in the Reconstruction of Japan by General Douglas MacArthur . Deming participated as a manufacturing consultant for Japan's struggling heavy industries, which included Toyota and Mitsubishi . Unlike what they experienced in the US, Deming found the Japanese very receptive to learning and applying these new efficiency methods. Many of the manufacturing methods first introduced by Deming in Japan, and later innovated by Japanese companies, are what we now call Lean Manufacturing. Japanese manufacturers still recognize Deming for his contributions to modern Japanese efficiency practices by awarding the best manufacturers in the world the Deming Prize .",

In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased.\" Plenert goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or just-in-time production methodology.

The 3D IC is one of several 3D integration schemes that exploit the z-direction to achieve electrical performance benefits in microelectronics and nanoelectronics . 3D integrated circuits can be classified by their level of interconnect hierarchy at the global ( package ), intermediate (bond pad) and local ( transistor ) level.",

In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain  one or more circuit boards. Originally, every electronic component had wire leads , and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and soldered to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction . In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered . The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army.

Analog circuits are very commonly represented in schematic diagrams , in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs Kirchhoff's circuit laws : all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor.",

However, Deming and Shewhart failed to convince other US manufacturers to apply these \"radical\" methods. After the war, Deming was assigned to participate in the Reconstruction of Japan by General Douglas MacArthur . Deming participated as a manufacturing consultant for Japan's struggling heavy industries, which included Toyota and Mitsubishi . Unlike what they experienced in the US, Deming found the Japanese very receptive to learning and applying these new efficiency methods. Many of the manufacturing methods first introduced by Deming in Japan, and later innovated by Japanese companies, are what we now call Lean Manufacturing. Japanese manufacturers still recognize Deming for his contributions to modern Japanese efficiency practices by awarding the best manufacturers in the world the Deming Prize .",

    "text": "However, in the latter case non-printing methods must be employed for the actual patterning step. [ 20 ] Inkjet printing is preferable for organic semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), but also OFETs completely prepared by this method have been demonstrated. [ 21 ] Frontplanes [ 22 ] and backplanes [ 23 ] of OLED-displays, integrated circuits, [ 24 ] organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs) [ 25 ] and other devices can be prepared with inkjets. Screen printing [ edit ] Screen printing is appropriate for fabricating electrics and electronics due to its ability to produce patterned, thick layers from paste-like materials. This method can produce conducting lines from inorganic materials (e.g. for circuit boards and antennas), but also insulating and passivating layers, whereby layer thickness is more important than high resolution. Its 50 m 2 /h throughput and 100 μm resolution are similar to inkjets.",

    "text": "The droplets are entrained in a gas stream and delivered to the print head. Here, an annular flow of clean gas is introduced around the aerosol stream to focus the droplets into a tightly collimated beam of material. The combined gas streams exit the print head through a converging nozzle that compresses the aerosol stream to a diameter as small as 10 μm. The jet of droplets exits the print head at high velocity (~50 meters/second) and impinges upon the substrate. Electrical interconnects, passive and active components [ 30 ] are formed by moving the print head, equipped with a mechanical stop/start shutter, relative to the substrate. The resulting patterns can have features ranging from 10 μm wide, with layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to >10 μm. [ 31 ] A wide nozzle print head enables efficient patterning of millimeter size electronic features and surface coating applications. All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers.",

    "text": "All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers. The high exit velocity of the jet enables a relatively large separation between the print head and the substrate, typically 2–5 mm. The droplets remain tightly focused over this distance, resulting in the ability to print conformal patterns over three dimensional substrates. Despite the high velocity, the printing process is gentle; substrate damage does not occur and there is generally minimal splatter or overspray from the droplets. [ 32 ] Once patterning is complete, the printed ink typically requires post treatment to attain final electrical and mechanical properties. Post-treatment is driven more by the specific ink and substrate combination than by the printing process.",

[ 7 ] While lean manufacturing focuses on optimization of the production stream and removal of wastes (commonly referred to as muda , mura , and muri ) once the value stream has been created, Lean Design ® (Munro & Associates) concerns itself with methods and techniques to create a lean solution from the start, resulting in more value and fewer wastes across the value stream. [ 8 ] Lean design ® seeks to optimize the development process through rapid learning cycles to build and test multiple concepts early.",

I tried using contraposition to get ((A ⊃ (~C ⊃ ~B)), then changing to ((A • ~C) ⊃ ~B), but I'm not sure how to use Modus Tollens and get (A • ~C) by itself since that would require getting ~~B, which can't happen as far as I know without getting one of the other variables anyway. So I'm stuck in a bit of a vicious cycle. Another problem that's giving me issues is: 1. (A ⊃ ~A) Pr. / ~A I thought using conditional exchange would be good here, since you could start from the premise and get (~A v ~~A) or get the same by working backward from the conclusion using Conditional Exchange, and this would be equivalent to (~A v A) due to Double Negation.",

    "text": "From there I tried DeMorgan's and got ~(A • ~A), but it's sort of \"trapped\" within the tilde even though I know replacement rules can still apply to any individual part (for example, I could still change it to ~(~~A • ~A) by Double Negation). Basically, I need to get A/~A by itself and somehow that should work out a proof that contradicts itself. One other thing, if I may; I completed this problem but am not sure if I'm misusing Conditional Exchange, and if I knew it could maybe help on the previous problem: 1.

It's just a lot of hard work getting the rules right in your head, like your first arithmetic courses. I am not going to comment on it too much, you need to rely on the didactical skills of your professors and your own skills here. Not a lot to do except for work your way through all of the exercises. (The \"distributive\" law you need should be obvious to you, probably is a side lemma, and probably can be proven by rewriting ⊃ to another form.)

    "text": "Good point. Baluncore said: But this thread is about the proof of the number of \"multiplies\" required for an FFT. Good point again: I should have read from the top! Albert01 14 0 I initially determined the number of Butterflies constructively, using the number of levels and the knowledge that ##N/2## butterflies are required in each level. .Scott said: The proof is fairly simple. Multiplications occur in the butterfly modules and in the preparation of the qk factors - but those qk factors can be prepared at \"compile time\". Only the butterfly multiplies are executed at run time. When N=1, the number of multiplies is zero. Each time you double N=2∗(N−1), you perform two \"N/2\" FFTs and then N/2 butterflies. This is the inductive proof? Not more? Last edited: Apr 19, 2024 Albert01 14 0 A suggestion for proof via induction from me. Please correct me if you find any mistakes! A confirmation would be nice!",

Most \"real world\" sorts are variations of quicksort or merge sort. For some unknown to me reason, top down merge sort is taught much more often than bottom up merge sort, although most \"real world\" merge sorts are variations of bottom up merge sort. A lot of algorithms are complex enough that most programmers use documentation, pseudo code, or actual code instead of trying to code based on memorization for those algorithms. In some cases, programmers will work with specific algorithms long enough that they will memorize them to the point they can recognize errors in code just by looking at the code, but that's not the norm. Even if a programmer knows an algorithm well enough to write code from scratch, if it's not for a learning experience, it's somewhat a waste of time to not take advantage of existing code or example.",

As has already been mentioned, linear search, bubble sort and selection sort algorithms are used mainly for educational purposes but this is good for the proper education in CS, as they are introduced early enough and give some context. There is no important professional standpoint about these. Binary search is a different story though, as learning it, serves many purposes and you will encounter it or something based on it many times, if you follow a career in programming. Now, about whether it is useful to memorize the pseudocode or not, it reminds me of similar concerns I had many years ago. As you'll progress into more advanced programming concepts and develop complex programs, you'll see that everything you tried to memorize simply faded out. So, there's no point to memorize pseudocode or code.",

    "text": "Now what I want to say is that using code has consequences and by understanding the code like sorting algorithms you open your mind in such a way that you start to see the usefulness and the limitations. This is a much appreciated skill and should be honed carefully. Understanding is the key. Being a programmer for more than 35 years I do remember the first steps which was on a VIC20 and C64. I got to understand multiplications and divisions up close and personal to improve 3D projections and matrix calculations. I analyzed the code step by step to see what could be improved or done in less steps. This also made it easier to remember algorithms later on. Remembering the exact implementation of a bubblesort comes with time. Just like playing the guitar or piano, it is practice and more practice. Some would say a useless skill to remember algorithms, I say it is the first step to understanding. Hope this helps.",

Having said that, there is an overriding reason to memorize them. When you interview for a job you will be grilled and tested on these issues, potentially intensely, and in many cases only the people who have had the foresight to memorize some potentially obscure algorithm/data structure will be competitive. Also you should begin practicing the types of coding challenges that are best solved through creative/clever use of data structures and algorithms (this is actually good for you in general).

Forums Other Sciences Programming and Computer Science Prime Number Detection: Running Time of Algorithm Thread starter zak100 Start date Mar 8, 2020 Tags Algorithm Detection Prime Running Time zak100 462 11 TL;DR Summary From the internet, I found that the running time of algorithm to find prime number is O(sqrt(N)). I have 3 questions: Can we say that the running time is O(log^2N) for detection of Prime number? For large values of N, can we say that its a pseudo-polynomial algorithm? Is this true for Sorting algorithms also? Zulfi.",

    "text": "Each node keeps track of how many higher children it has. You start with a root node containing 5. Then you add 2 as the \"lower child\" of 5, then 3 as the \"higher child\" of 2 (because it's lower than 5, but 5 already has a lower child but 2 doesn't have a higher child), then 1 as the \"lower child\" of 2 (5 already has a lower child but 2 doesn't), then 4 as the \"higher child\" of 3 (5 has a lower child, 2 has a higher child, but 3 doesn't). If you keep track of how many child nodes have been added on the higher subtree of each one, I think you can work out how many higher numbers you've already seen without having to check every one, which ought to be better than ##O(n^2)##.
